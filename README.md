# CRM-Demo

This project is the backend for a React frontend project. The main idea was to implement what I have learned in the Udemy course.
The project is implemented using Sprin REST, Spring Boot, Spring AOP and Hibernate. 


# API Calls
- GET_MAPPING url = /api/customer : Get the list of all customers.
- GET_MAPPING url = /api/customer/{id} : Get the customer with the id value.
- POST_MAPPING url = /api/customer : Add the customer in the Request body.
- PUT_MAPPING url = /api/customer/{id} : Update the customer with the new customer params.
- DELETE_MAPPING url = /api/customer/{id} : Delete the customer with the requested id.
